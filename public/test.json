Only 36 of these cars were made between 1962 and 1963; the specific Ferrari that’s the most expensive in the world, at an unbelievable $70,000,000 price point, was victorious not only in the Tour de France, but it also placed in the Le Mans.With a top speed of 174 miles per hour and an acceleration of 0-100kph (0-60mph) in 6.1 seconds, its stats certainly don’t thrill today’s auto enthusiasts by itself. However, in the ‘60s, it was the fastest in the world – and, now, decades later, it remains the most expensive car in the world of all time by a long shot.",
